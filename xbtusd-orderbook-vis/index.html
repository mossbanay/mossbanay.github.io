    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Orderbooks are tables that show the immediate and public supply and demand of
instruments that trade on financial exchanges. They collate orders that specify
the direction, price and volume at which a party wants to trade an instrument.</p>
<p>I have collected several months of orderbook snapshots from the perpetual XBTUSD
contract on the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/app/trade/XBTUSD">BitMEX</a>. Here I want to show
some simple visualisations that give more detail into the drivers of particular
changes in price that are not observable with more common candlestick charts.
Orderbook charts are not however a substitute for candlestick charts, but show
different information, in particular over shorter timespans.</p>
<h2 id="image-visualisation-for-machine-learning">Image visualisation for machine learning</h2>
<p>These visualisations were motivated by the <a href="https://course.fast.ai">fast.ai lectures</a> where Jeremy Howard
outlined the success previous students had found when converting strangely
shaped datasets into images to be used in more conventional image based methods.
In particular <esman2017splunk> found great success in classifying fraudulent
activity by converting mouse movement data into images and feeding them into
CNNs. <nino2019dltick> outlines a different method of orderbook visualisation
not discussed in this article for the purposes of predicting the direction of
the future price of US and Brazilian equities, a Gramian Angular Field.
<sharma2019deepinsight> actually attempt to automate the process, providing
two straightforward approaches for converting tabular data into images and
analyse the effectiveness on textual and genomic classification problems.</p>
<h2 id="generating-images-with-matplotlib">Generating images with matplotlib</h2>
<p>Orderbook snapshots unlike neat and tidy economic time series do not occur at
regular intervals. Sometimes an orderbook may change hundreds of times a second
but later in the day it may not change for minutes. The first step involved
resampling the irregular snapshots to a particular frequency. In my case I
choose bars that are 100ms wide (about 1/3 of the blink of an eye).</p>
<p>After resampling the data, I first tried using matplotlib, drawing each price
level separately as a thin vertical bar. A light tan or pinkish colour
represents low value while the darker purple areas represent larger volume. If
you look closely you&rsquo;ll see a thin white gap which is called the spread. This is
the difference between the lowest price you can buy at (the offer) and the
highest price you can sell at (the bid).</p>
<figure><img src="./matplotlib_234.png"
    alt="Figure 1: Sideways movement with deeper liquidity" width="200px"><figcaption>
      <p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Sideways movement with deeper liquidity</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On either side of the white gap is a blue line tracking the bid and an orange
line tracking the offer. Shortly after large trades or significant events in the
market, the spread widens and you&rsquo;ll see the bid and offer move outward until
more orders come in and the price tightens back up.</p>
<figure><img src="./matplotlib_282.png"
    alt="Figure 2: A particularly volatile and thin orderbook" width="200px"><figcaption>
      <p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>A particularly volatile and thin orderbook</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this case we can see a large bid inserted into the book after the price
begins to settle down (shown as the dark purple/black line). Since these colours
represent (in an ideal world) real demand to buy or sell the instrument, you
might expect that darker colours below the white gap (large orders to buy) would
lead to a net increase in the price over the near future. For example, as shown
in Figure 3. However the lack of real regulation in cryptocurrency markets have
led to frequent spoofing, where large orders are placed in an effort to fake
supply or demand and manipulate the price, without the intention of those orders
being filled.</p>

    alt="Figure 3: Price moving up in response to large bids" width="50px"><figcaption>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="drawing-pixel-by-pixel">Drawing pixel by pixel</h2>
<p>When using these images as input to a simple CNN, a recurring issue was the CNN
would latch onto small thin lines in the matplotlib generated images. If you
look closely you may be able to see them between the price levels. These strange
aberrations were not meaningful, and therefore I tried a more direct method for
generating the images.</p>
<p>I choose to generate two-channel images (one for the bids and one for the asks)
and draw one pixel for each step in the resampled data. The x-coordinate equal
to time and the y-coordinate equal to the volume. This led to images that look
like the following.</p>
<figure><img src="./pixel_1326.png"
    alt="Figure 4: More sideways movement with stronger bids" width="200px"><figcaption>
      <p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>More sideways movement with stronger bids</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One important decision is how to compress the wide range of values for the
volume at a level into an 8-bit value that can be used in an image. It&rsquo;s pretty
easy to argue that either \(\sqrt{x}\) or \(\log{x}\) is a sensible choice for
scaling. I used \(\sqrt{x}\) in these images. This ended up leading to visually
pleasing images with a punchy green for large bids and bright red for large
asks.</p>
<figure><img src="./pixel_1060.png"
    alt="Figure 5: Movement within a range with large bids and offers" width="300px"><figcaption>
      <p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5: </span>Movement within a range with large bids and offers</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This choice of how to normalise the volume is however crucial in being able to
convey a meaningful representation of what has happened over the image. Another
choices might be to adjust the colour based on a rolling average of how much has
been traded recently, which would adjust for periods of high or low volatility.</p>
<p>While the images were saved as simple pngs with three channels, it&rsquo;s safe to
throw away the third channel if using it as an input to a CNN since it is
totally zero.</p>
