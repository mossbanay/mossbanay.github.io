    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this article we&rsquo;ll review Q-learning and walk through a subtle improvement
that leads to Double Q-learning and better policies. We&rsquo;ll then look at this in
action, and compare the two methods on a toy problem.</p>
<h2 id="reinforcement-learning-refresher">Reinforcement learning refresher</h2>
<p>In this article I assume a familiarity with reinforcement learning and the
standard Q-learning algorithm. In this section I&rsquo;ll provide a brief review of
the basic terminology, which you can feel free to skip if you&rsquo;re comfortable in
doing so.</p>
<p>Reinforcement learning is a field of machine learning that has risen in
popularity particularly over the last 10 years riding on the achivements in
areas like computer Go and computational chemistry. There are a few core
elements in the field.</p>
<p>The <strong>environment</strong> is a model or representation of the current state of the
world. In this article you can assume it is discrete and fully observable
(although in partial information games like poker, this is not the case). The
<strong>agent</strong> follows a <strong>policy</strong> which maps each state to an action the agent makes
when interacting with the environment. This action then produces a new
observation representing the new state of the environment and a scalar <strong>reward</strong>.</p>
<p>The goal of reinforcement learning is to find a policy for the agent that
maximises the cumulative rewards emitted from the environment. <strong>Q-learning</strong> is
one particular approach that estimates a policy without requiring perfect
knowledge of the dynamics of the environment (e.g. the probability transition
matrix of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process">MDP</a>).</p>
<h2 id="q-learning-algorithm-refresher">Q-learning algorithm refresher</h2>
<p>Q-learning generates a policy using a table of bootstrapped &ldquo;q-values&rdquo; that
correspond to the <em>quality</em> of an action. Concretely, they are a mapping from a
state \(s\) and action \(a\) to a scalar. If \(S\) is the set of states and \(A\) the
set of actions then,</p>
<p>\[ Q : S \times A \to \mathbb{R} \]</p>
<p>The <em>optimal</em> q-value function, denoted \(Q^*\), satisfies something called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation">Bellman equation</a> and implies that \(Q^*(s,a)\) is equal to the expected future
rewards if the agent plays \(a\) in \(s\). If we know \(Q^*\) then the trivial policy
derived from it is to choose \(a\) that maximises \(Q(s,a)\) given our current state
\(s\). We commonly denote a policy with \(\pi\).</p>
<p>\[ \pi^* : S \to A \]
\[ \pi^*(s) = \underset{a}{\text{arg max }} Q^*(s, a) \]</p>
<p>If we assume there are a finite number of states and a finite number of actions
then \(S\) and \(A\) are finite sets. This means we can think of \(Q\) as a lookup
table. The issue now is that we don&rsquo;t know \(Q^*\) and have to estimate it over
time as we observe rewards and transitions between states as the agent makes
actions. At time \(t\) the estimated q-value function is denoted \(Q_t\) and the
corresponding policy \(\pi_t\).</p>
<p>Q-learning iteratively improves \(Q_t\) using the following update equation
applied with a new transition from \(s\) to \(s^{\prime}\) after the agent took an action
\(a\) leading to a reward of \(r\).</p>
<p>\[ Q_{t+1}(s, a) := Q_t(s, a) + \alpha \left ( r + \gamma \thinspace \underset{a^{\prime}}{\text{max }} Q_t(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime}) - Q_t(s, a) \right ) \]</p>
<p>Where \(\alpha \in (0, 1]\) is a scalar learning rate and \(\gamma \in [0,1]\) is a
scalar discount factor (you don&rsquo;t need to worry too much about either of these).
This looks a little scary but really it&rsquo;s just linear interpolation between our
old estimate \(Q_t(s, a)\) and our new estimate \(r + \gamma \thinspace
\underset{a^{\prime}}{\text{max }} Q_t(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime})\). We can
rewrite the update equation like so,</p>
<p>\[ Q_{t+1}(s, a) := (1 - \alpha) \thinspace Q_t(s, a) + \alpha \left ( r + \gamma \thinspace \underset{a^{\prime}}{\text{max }} Q_t(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime}) \right) \]</p>
<p>to illustrate this point. The greater \(\alpha\) is, the more weight we put on our
new estimate of the q-value. It is shown by <jaakkola1994convergence> that if
we allow \(\alpha\) to vary over time and approach 0 then \(Q_t\) will converge to
\(Q^*\) (great!).</p>
<h2 id="a-closer-look-at-our-estimator">A closer look at our estimator</h2>
<p>Until now we&rsquo;ve looked at the problem from a specific and applied point of view.
Let&rsquo;s now take a step back and look at a particular part of the update equation
and see if we can improve upon it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already stated that our current estimate with the new transition is given
by</p>
<p>\[ r + \gamma \thinspace \underset{a^{\prime}}{\text{max }} Q_t(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime}) \]</p>
<p>This expression tells us that we&rsquo;re moving \(Q_{t+1}(s, a)\) towards the reward we
just received \(r\) plus the expected cumulative rewards in the future. It&rsquo;s
important to distinguish between the estimator and the parameter of the latter
part. The value we&rsquo;re trying to estimate is</p>
<p>\[ \underset{a^{\prime}}{\text{max }} Q^*(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime}) \]</p>
<p>and the estimator we&rsquo;re using is</p>
<p>\[ \underset{a^{\prime}}{\text{max }} Q_t(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime}) \]</p>
<p>A more general formulation of this problem is given a set of \(k\) random
variables \(X = \{X_1, \ldots, X_n\}\) find the maximum expected value of the
random variables. The issue here is that the <em>choice of the estimator</em> used in
Q-learning is <em>tied to the value</em> of the estimator. Estimators with unusually
large values at time \(t\) are chosen more frequently, and this leads to an
exaggeration of the true value of the next state. Therefore we end up being
optimistic, which we&rsquo;ll later see can lead to worse policies before convergence
to \(Q^*\). This issue is called <strong>maximisation bias</strong>.</p>
<p>A key contribution by <hasselt2010double> seeks to address this issue by
decoupling the estimator from its value. Instead of maintaining a single
estimate of \(Q_t(s, a)\) we separate the samples we collect into two distinct
subsets and use them to produce two different estimators (tables of q-values).
To estimate the future value of a state, we choose the best action (just as with
regular Q-learning) using one of the tables, but instead we use the
corresponding q-value <em>in the other table</em>. This approach is called <strong>Double
Q-learning</strong>, for obvious reasons. For example suppose our q-value estimates for
a particular state \(s\) are given as follows.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Action</th>
          <th>\(Q_t^1(s, a)\)</th>
          <th>\(Q_t^2(s, a)\)</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>\(a_1\)</td>
          <td>-4.9</td>
          <td>-2.3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>\(a_2\)</td>
          <td>2.3</td>
          <td>4.3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>\(a_3\)</td>
          <td>4.0</td>
          <td>3.5</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>With regular Q-learning we choose the action with the highest q-value and use
that q-value as the estimate of the value. Here if we use \(Q_t^1(s, a)\) that
gives us \(a_3\) for an estimated value of 4.0. With Double Q-learning we still
select \(a_3\) but we use the value from \(Q_t^2(s, a)\) giving us an estimate of
3.5.</p>
<p>It can be shown that this is <em>also</em> a biased estimator, but with a negative
bias rather than a positive bias as with regular Q-learning.</p>
<h2 id="illustration-of-maximisation-bias">Illustration of maximisation bias</h2>
<p>We will use the example given in <sutton2018reinforcement> under section 6.7.
Suppose we have a MDP like the following.</p>
<figure><img src="./bandits_graph.png" width="500px">
</figure>

<p>When we start the game we have two options avaliable to us. If we play <code>Right</code>
the game immediately ends and we receive a reward of 0. If we play <code>Left</code> we
move to another state <code>Gamble</code> and receive a reward of 0. From <code>Gamble</code> we can
choose one of \(k\) different actions. Upon selecting one of these actions the
game ends and we receive a random reward drawn from a \(\mathcal{N}(-0.1, 1)\)
distribution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that we learn our policy without knowing the
structure of this MDP (otherwise we already know to always choose <code>Right</code>).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the policies learnt with Q-learning and Double Q-learning when
playing in this environment. Below we post the percentage of time the algorithm
chooses to take <code>Left</code> from the initial state. The optimal policy plays <code>Left</code>
5% of the time due to detail in our training process <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The curve
is created by repeating the training process from scratch many times to smooth
it out. Below is the graph for \(k=4\).</p>
<figure><img src="./qlearn_behaviour.png" width="500px">
</figure>

<p>Given our initial estimates of the q-values we are indifferent to either <code>Left</code>
or <code>Right</code> so we take <code>Left</code> about half the time. Soon after, Q-learning begins
to take <code>Left</code> much more frequently. This is usually caused by being lucky on
one of the \(k\) actions from the <code>Gamble</code> state, causing our q-value to be
positive and therefore greater than the value of taking <code>Right</code>. Over time as we
collect more samples our estimate gradually begins to reflect the actual reward
distribution which has a mean of -0.1.</p>
<p>In contrast, we see that Double Q-learning very quickly adjusts and is not
affected by any lucky draws from actions taken in the <code>Gamble</code> state. Double
Q-learning performs much better in this game, and empirically this has been the
recurring theme across many games. Even though both methods converge to \(Q^*\)
the policies <em>in the meantime</em> tend to be better in most games when being
pessimistic. This is particularly remarkable since when Double Q-learning splits
the samples into two groups, the variance of the estimators grows. This means it
has lower sample efficiency, but despite this, removing the optimism from
Q-learning still usually outweighs this disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>We have reviewed the basic Q-learning algorithm as an approach to reinforcement
learning. We saw that you can view the update equation as simple linear
interpolation between the existing estimate and a new observation of the
q-value. We looked at how you can improve the forward looking estimate of future
cumulative reward, and how the estimator chosen for this quantity is tied to its
value. This is addressed by Double Q-learning which we saw in the dummy problem
tends to exhibit much better policies whilst maintaing the same convergence
property towards the optimal q-value function \(Q^*\).</p>

<p>We use epsilon-greedy exploration while training for both
algorithms with epsilon fixed at 90%. Therefore optimally <code>Right</code> is
always choosen in the greedy step, and since <code>Left</code> is chosen 50% of the time in
the explore step, an optimal policy plays <code>Left</code> 5% of the time.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
