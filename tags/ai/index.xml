      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-pressure-for-agents&#34;&gt;Back pressure for agents&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might notice a pattern in the most successful applications of agents over the last year. Projects that are able to&#xA;setup structure around the agent itself, to provide it with automated feedback on quality and correctness, have been able&#xA;to push them to work on longer horizon tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;back pressure&lt;/strong&gt; helps the agent identify mistakes as it progresses and models are now good enough that this feedback&#xA;can keep them aligned to a task for much longer. As an engineer, this means you can increase your leverage by delegating&#xA;progressively more complex tasks to agents, while increasing trust that when completed they are at a satisfactory standard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
